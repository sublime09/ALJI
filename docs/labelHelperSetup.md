### Run application

## Task Structure



- [**Download Link for Windows**](https://github.com/sublime09/ALJI/releases/latest/download/ALJI_Label_Helper_Windows.zip)
     - Remember to extract the zipped/compressed folder before running the program.  Windows lets you 'peek' into compressed folders, but the programs inside will be unreliable until you extract them fully.  [Example of the correctly extracted folder](assets/img/alji_open_on_windows.png)
     - Tested on Windows 10. Other systems may vary in results.
- [**Download Link for OSX**](https://github.com/sublime09/ALJI/releases/latest/download/ALJI_Label_Helper_Mac.zip)
     - **Note**: Macs may prevent you from starting the program because I am not registered as an "Apple Developer". After decompressing the folder, move the 'ALJI Label Helper' program to your Applications folder to reveal an option to open the unrecognized program and run it normally.  [Reference Screenshot](./assets/img/alji_open_on_mac.png)
     - Tested on OSX 10.4 (Mojave). Other systems may may vary in results.
     - Known bug: sometimes the main view appears frozen and unresponsive.
       - Workaround: Scrolling in the main view, or navigating to another journal will refresh the view.

From this point, it is simply decompress the .zip file, open the folder, and launch the "ALJI Label Helper" program inside.

**Troubleshooting / Reporting errors:**
- Contact Patrick: [sublime@vt.edu](mailto:sublime@vt.edu) and describe the error you encountered.
- A screenshot of the error is usually very helpful
- Attaching the “err.log” file found near the program may help as well.

## Concerning Journal Examples 

> ... *Day after day, I somehow wake up more tired than the day before. The air resists me like a syrup, and yet I can only stare at the ceiling while yearning for sleep to come over me.* ...

**Reasoning:** The author could definitely be experiencing insomnia and psychomotor retardation.  Both of those labels should be 'checked' for this journal. 

> ... *By my third year in Newton, I had lost all hope of feeling normal again.  Every memory of my mother was now stained with her death* ...

**Reasoning:** While these feelings are focused on past events, the author may still feel them today.  We should check 'Intrusive memory of past trauma' and 'Recurrent thoughts of death'.  ALJI's final prototype can confirm if an author still has these thoughts and feelings.  

> ... *I joked about my traumatic stay at a foster home filled with verbal abuse when I was nine.  But they only stared back instead of laughing.  So I quickly told them how I had mostly forgotten about it (a lie).* ...

**Reasoning:** While the events happened in the past, it is unclear if the author's feelings are resolved about this today.  'Stressful traumatic event' would be a good label to select. 

## Safe Journal Examples

> ... *I became used to my little brother's panicked yells in the night.  Each time I thought that the night terrors would make him think twice about watching another scary movie, but he would always ask to rent another one.* ...

**Reasoning:** It is not the author experiencing the night terrors, and they seem accustomed to it instead of distressed.  There is no labels to check based off of these sentences.

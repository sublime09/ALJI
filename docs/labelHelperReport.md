To report your label results and finalize your contribution:

1. Locate the label results
    - Find the folder named “LabelResults” in the same location where you ran the program.
    - Inside the folder should be files similar to “Group1Labels.json”. These are the label results you created by using the program. You can read their contents like a normal text file. 
2. Email the researcher (Patrick Sullivan) the results: [​sublime@vt.edu](mailto:sublime@vt.edu?subect=ALJI_results)
    - Attach the JSON file you previously located to the email
    - Feel free to add any thoughts, concerns, questions about the ALJI project.
    - The researcher may respond through email asking for clarification on custom labels, or errors that can occur.
